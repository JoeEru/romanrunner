Chariot racing (Latin: Ludi Circenses) was one of the most popular ancient
Roman sports. More : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariot_racing

This exercise is not about a race or a competition, it is about a single
player in a Circenses, where a player tries to collect coins. The Circenses
is represented by a rectangle with a start line at the bottom, and a final
line at top. There are two tracks in the Circenses : the left tack and the
right track. A player start the race at the start line, and is represented by
the first letter of his name in capital letter.

We can find many objects in the Circensus tracks : 
#### o  : a coin
#### _  : an obstacle
#### ## : the finish line
